### **Tic-Tac-Toe Game **  

I have developed a **Tic-Tac-Toe** game using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** with the following features:  

 **1. Two-player gameplay** – Players take turns marking X or O on the grid.  
 **2. Winner detection** – The game automatically checks for a winner based on predefined win patterns.  
 **3. Winning message display** – Displays a congratulatory message when a player wins.  
 **4. Reset button** – Allows players to restart the game anytime.  
 **5. Responsive design** – Ensures smooth gameplay across different screen sizes.  
 **6. JavaScript DOM manipulation** – Enhances interactivity with real-time updates.  

This project is great for practicing **JavaScript event handling** and **game logic implementation**!
